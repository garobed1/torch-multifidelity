# torch-multifidelity

This repo contains scripts for performing multifidelity uncertainty quantification for the ICP torch, relying on the `bluest` Python package to solve the sample allocation problem and estimate torch output statistical moments.


### current data

Currently, the scripts rely on collected simulation sample output data from `torch1D` and `tps`, considering input chemistry uncertainties which are modeled based on scripts from the `torch-chemistry` repo and propagated through the torch codes using scripts from the `torch-sensitivity` repo. Contact @garobed1 to inquire about obtaining the most up-to-date data, which are stored in individual directories per model and model group in particular `.pickle` formats.

### functionality

With the appropriate data, you can run `torch_bluest_solves.py` to estimate model covariances, solve the sample allocation problem, and make UQ estimates based on the allocated samples.
